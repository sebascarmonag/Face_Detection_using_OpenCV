1. Visual Studio Code is assumed to be installed
2. Create and open a folder
3. We need a Python file in order to `import` __OpenCV__ into
4. Open __Terminal__
5. We should create a __Virtual Environment__, with the following code. make sure you know your version of Python you are using.  
   ```python3.10 - venv STUDYsession```
6. Activate our __Virtual Environment__ with the code `source STUDYsession/bin/activate`. You can see you are working on a __Virtual Environment__ because the terminal line will have parentheses named with the name you assigned to you enviroment
7. Upgrade `pip` by typing `pip3 install --upgrade pip` this will install the latest version of pip
